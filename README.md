This is a simple HTML exercise from the Odin Project wherein I create a homepage and three different recipe pages. The homepage links to each recipe and each recipe has a link to the homepage.

Within each recipe page there is an image, a brief description, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of recipe steps.

While a simple exercise, it was a great way to review lists, linking between web pages, and general HTML content/elements. The specific elements in question being images, lists, and text (headings and paragraphs).
