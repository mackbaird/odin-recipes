    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>3.5 ounces chopped dark chocolate</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Generously butter the insides of four 5 Â½-ounce ramekins.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk egg yolks, eggs, and sugar together in a bowl with an electric
        mixer until foamy and lighter in color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second
        intervals until melted, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir melted chocolate mixture into egg and sugar mixture until combined.
        Sift in cocoa powder and stir to combine. Sift in flour and salt; stir
        to combine into a batter. Stir in vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer batter to a resealable plastic bag. Snip off one corner of the
        bag with scissors to create a tip. Divide batter evenly between the
        prepared ramekins; gently tap ramekins on the counter to remove any air
        bubbles. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Arrange chilled ramekins in a casserole dish. Pour enough warm tap water
        into the casserole dish to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes. Remove from the oven and
        let cool for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loosen the edges from each ramekin with a knife. Invert cakes onto
        serving plates and dust with powdered sugar.
